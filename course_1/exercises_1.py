# Fix the errors in the following code cells.

# EXERCISE 1:
# Fix the error in the following code
# print(There are 366 days in a leap year")
# Plan
# Ensure the string is enclosed in double quotes.
# Add the missing opening double quote.

print("There are 366 days in a leap year")

# EXERCISE 2:
# Fix the error in the following code
# print("There are 366
# days in a leap year")

print("""There are 366
days in a leap year""")

# EXERCISE 3:
# A foot was defined as exactly 0.3048 meters in 1959. Convert 6 feet to meters.

# Write code to convert 6 feet to meters
print("Convert 6 feet to meters")

# Plan
# 1. Define the conversion factor from feet to meters.
# 2. Multiply 6 feet by the conversion factor to get the result in meters.
# 3. Print the result.

# Conversion factor from feet to meters
feet_to_meters = 0.3048

# Convert 6 feet to meters
meters = 6 * feet_to_meters

# Print the result
print(f"6 feet is {meters} meters")
